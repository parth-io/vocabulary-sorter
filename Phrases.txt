If it were a country, Uttar Pradesh (UP) would rank just ahead of Brazil in population, right next to Britain in land area and close to Lesotho in poverty. Measured by the complexity of its politics, though, India’s most populous state is second to none. With a plethora of faiths, castes and political allegiances, spiced up by garish nepotism, rank criminality and a first-past-the-post voting system prone to wild swings, elections in UP are always raucous and notoriously tricky to predict.

Sumptuous/Resplendent in gold and marble, graced by chandeliers and silk, washed with light slanting up from the River, this palace is where the treaty was negotiated.
A sophisticated guise
Kneading one's brow
Kindle strife
Look askance
The ramose tree sheltered us from the blistering sun.
Peace accords
Administer unction
Something features to excess.
Shoulder aside people from one's path
… even though he never said a word, he had more than one trick up his sleeve, the old slyboots.
Underpin a semblance of normality
To go ballistic
Retroussé
Wintry age
Unearthly song
A hole rimmed by rocks
Dusty years
His creations
His cheek was scumbled with an impending beard
Craggy trees
A teasing melody
Droves of insects
A furious crowd of sparrow
Mantle of water
A chorus of squeaks and chatters
Her lined face was scribed with a delicate pattern of lines
He hefted his load
Swatch of moss
A mulled scent
Maculated dome
Matted hair
To no avail
Moody depths of the forest
Corded arms and chests
Machiolated towers
Jam your heels
Flushed face
Barbed shadows
Molting deer
Unerring aim
The attendant difficulties of motherhood
Grind someone beneath your heel
Impenetrable barier
The trill of a bird
His gaze was tempered with pity
In unison
In tow
Windblown sapling
They tamped out the fire
Bare his teeth
Minutest detail
Events in India move apace
The forest yammered with the noise of the animals
Buckling knees
The ruddy glow of a lantern
Obsessiv craving
A forced stillness
Light limned her
Rainwater cached in the leaves and branches after the raun stopped showered the weary travellers if they accidentally banged into a tree bole
He bore a radiant expression
Nicked weapons
Messianic zeal
He compounded the issue
He commented snidely
He was loath to leave her
Crooked neck
The deer bounded over the log
Clang and clamour
Piercing screech
Waves of prickly green trees rolled unbroken into the distance
Eagerness twined over with longing adoration
Buffeting wings
A vast expanse
Pitted surface
Red in tooth and claw
The dog lapped up the tea
Dome of darkness
Tremors racked his thin frame
Uncounted masses
The crashing din of the animals
Her smoky voice guttered and rasped
Dimpled skin
Mend the rift
Wax eloquent
A clearing washed with moonlight
Relief coursed through him
Forge up the river
Nameless terror
A wending road
Cataract of a waterfall
Peal of laughter
Benevolent matriarch
His curses floated across the water
Immense entity
Hewn open
A worn visage
He crowed wih excitment
Pity welled up in him
Clump together
A measured pace
Yawning cleft
A humped back
A plume of flame
Laughter bubbled up in him
In the confines of the glades
Sheaves of papers were piled high
A quickening pace
Visions beset him
Fend off
She ferried the parcel
Say their fill
Address every reasonable objection
The animals hid in their den
Rifle through
Of your own volition
Radiant joy
A mass of milling cavalrymen
Bolt upright
The deep folds of his skin
In earshot
Absolute fealty
As silent as a tomb
The government exceeded the bounds of statehood and sovereignty
Through many a scrape and fight
A vast, puzzled sadness
Given due consideration
Wage war
Pained expressions
Ebbing out of
Wry smile
Petty worries
Twinkling sky
The muscles in his arm rippled
Banded muscles
Nickering horses
Discard all semblance
Gape at
Dimpled cheeks
Splattering of splotches
Gain admittance to
Hurried excuses
He knit his fingers together in pensive thought
He surveyed the room
Ruffled looks of a ruffian
The horses bucked and ran
A receptacle of hope
Bugles of triumph and joy
A select few
Looming large
In quick succession
Lope around
The rights of office
Ruffled hair
A clutch of larvae
Lace ruffs
Tail tucked between his legs
A husky warble of a voice
In minute detail
Everyone reeled from the shock
He wanted the rights due to his office
Tramping feet
Riddled with arrows, the sheep flailed in the throes of death
Seep through
Tweak his beard
Emotion clogged his chest
Beady eyes
Bleached landscapes
A dizzying wrench
Minister to
To put too fine a point on it
Aquiline fingers
He pried the rock out of the ground
Puffs of smoke
Bustle about
A bearable existence
Without meaning to
Flared nostrils
Winding alleys
Pain lanced up his bodyguard
Harbour affection
A thin shock of hair
On the brink
Prating girls
Advertise the situation
Orchestrate something
Bridle at
Piercing gaze
Traipse off
Stinging defeats
Flecked fur
Sleek mane of hair
Abuse her power
An even voice
I shall do the same in a like manner
He became an empty husk of a man
Gamboling among the trees
Cowed peasants
At their disposal
Hair plastered flat by the helmet
Flare of jealousy
Sweat beaded his brow
Reject her out of hand
The quiet mere, the still tarn
Flit through
To respect someone's station and office
Dread like a current of bilious water
A tremor racked him
Modulated voice
Business and family affairs
Stave in
Deadly quiet
Sway someone
Veins ridged his neck
Motive energy
Gild the lily
Render unto someone
An inexact art
Split lips
She bade them take their leave
Challenging prospect
Chance upon
Sidle closer
A layer of leaves blanketed the floor
A full scope
The cat occasionally flicked its tail
Do your bidding
Tears starting down her cheeks
Meld into each other
Flushed from the heat of the momeent
Splayed feet
An ability to divine people's intentions
Account for
Dwell on the past
Roots that knuckled up out of the earth
Gaze at
Haunting melodies
Privy to secrets
Stagger against
Drum out a maddenning beat
Maps and other douments of import
Grapple with
Stalks of grass
Ward off blow after blow
Ferret out
If he was so inclined, he could write a poem
Prancing horses
Oxen lowing to each other
Starving weasels
In pursui of
A wan smile
Unsavoury glee
Ward off evil
Baying of wolves
Cast off chain
Morass of trampled dirt
Intent upon
The chafing of manacles
Unguarded thought
Wrest him away
Amble through
Pique his curiosity
A crackling nimbus
Without compare
Hearty meal
Glide off
Rain sheeted from the roof
Utter confusion
Snuck in
His head drooped in sympathy with the mournful emotions surging through him
Oblique light
Trample over
Runnels of sweat
His anger subsided
A film of tears glazed his eyes
Studied indifference
Trestle tables laden with food
Unsaid secrets
Wrenching feeling
He escaped before the lot of them could descend upon him
Trickle down
Beholden to
Poor fare
Dance a jig
The teeming masses
Clinching off the bagpack, he prepared to depart
Shy away
The bright lantern left yellow afterimages streaked across his field of vision
Grabbing fistfuls of hair
With a swirl of her skirts, she flounced off
Nibbling the grass
Books devoted to magic
Fearsome and formidable
It was as if she had raked my chest with claws
At her urrging
Glittering motes of dust
The doings of men
Cut a striking figure
Troubled facedBoon
Trade stories
The carpet was sheared away
In no uncertain terms
An earth shelf reared out of the ground
Clasp tightly
Grit your teeth
The empty desert expanse
A faint wash of light appeared
Spring back upright
Items that are magical in and of themselves
Resort to the contingency plan
Comment upon
The mysterious smile lent his features a secretive cast
Cast in iron
Bunched muscles
What he heard set his scalp atingle
Stifling constraints
At her bidding
An oncoming blow
They strove against each other
Drift through
A wave of weariness washed over him
Strike a crippling blow
Stalk after
For a span
Without further ado
A war that racked the world
Staked his car on the wager
Hue and cry
Fell deeds
Studded with jewels
Inrush of air
Utterly loyal to
He craned his neck
He muttered a few fumbling words
Deprived of
Prick your hide
He kneaded dough
The evil clutches of tyrannt
A slow, deliberate tone
A detached look
Poised for action
In someone's stead
Lope out
Spirit away
Squirrel away
A testy and flinty response to a barbed question
Nurse someone back to health
An unblinking gaze
Meaningless pleasantries
He downed a tankard of ale
Noble sentiments
Harried by a thousand worries
In the far reaches
In accordance
Winded from running
A mottled veil of rust, a scrim of corrosion
Pore over
A swaddling babe
Sidle up
Cock your head
A platter of food
Fraught with peril
Clump of brambles
Her face was clouded with disappointment
Bargain on
Lumber over
They do not incline toward open displays of love
Clamp shut
Swords were leveled at her
Upturned face
Leech off
A storehouse of knowledge
A mane of sparks rose up from the fire
Sullen fire
Learning the workings of the business
The peals of bells
Overly hasty decisions
Peer at
Unshed tears
Fey magic
Silence pervaded the room
He was sound asleep
He darted here and there
The minister and his ilk
Possess the means
A shock of leaves
Posy of flowers
Keep your own counsel
Nigh on
The fickle crowd
The plan was of the king's design
The bodyguards were ranged about the minister
A glorious spectacle
Lopped off
Arch an eyebrow
Well up
Improve someone's lot in life
A stinging slap
Shroud of canvas
Gnash your teeth over the problem
An inconvenient episode
Take a liking to
Strained smiles
In spite of
Pouncing cats
She nipped constantly at her husband
Brace himself
Bide your time
It bolted away
His face regisetered sudden relief
Droves of cattle
Affect a false bravado
A speed born of practice
Her free-flowing locks of hair
Sound enoug
Rolling landscape
She tossed her head like a horse
Pitted against
Roots of the problem
Drooping eyes
Dabbed his eyes
A symbol branded on the rock
Untold havoc
The rumbling of traffic
In fine fettle
Flailing arms
Pearlike teeth of a kid
Bushy eyebrows
Gales of merriment
He was vaulted straight into the inner circle of advisers
Woe unto others
Agony coursed through him
The drop spindle of fate
Shifting mist and twisting banks of fog
Behind a veil of trees
It fared well
Wrestling kittens
Right the scales of justice
Part ranks
Sickening lurches
Dispose of
Guttering candles
Tufted ears
Bared his teeth
Scraps of paper
A cluster of
